## How it works
This project is a tiny RISC-V SoC built specifically for TinyTapeout.
Inside the chip, a PicoRV32 CPU runs a small firmware program stored in ROM. The CPU reads the buttons, updates the brightness level, and controls two peripherals:



## How to test

You can test the project directly on the TinyTapeout demo board or in simulation:


## External hardware

Your design uses only standard TinyTapeout demo board components.
No additional external hardware is required.
